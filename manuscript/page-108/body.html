<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>   THERE runs a road by Merrow Down—
     A grassy track to-day it is
   An hour out of Guildford town,
     Above the river Wey it is.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Here, when they heard the horse-bells ring,
     The ancient Britons dressed and rode
   To watch the dark Phoenicians bring
     Their goods along the Western Road.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   And here, or hereabouts, they met
     To hold their racial talks and such—
   To barter beads for Whitby jet,
     And tin for gay shell torques and such.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   But long and long before that time
     (When bison used to roam on it)
   Did Taffy and her Daddy climb
     That down, and had their home on it.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
