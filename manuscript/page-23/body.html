     Or frowst with a book by the fire;
   But to take a large hoe and a shovel also,
     And dig till you gently perspire;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   And then you will find that the sun and the wind.
   And the Djinn of the Garden too,
       Have lifted the hump—
       The horrible hump—
   The hump that is black and blue!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   I get it as well as you-oo-oo—
   If I haven’t enough to do-oo-oo—
       We all get hump—
       Cameelious hump—
   Kiddies and grown-ups too!</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
