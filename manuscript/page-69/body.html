   Or followed the track that they flew in,
   For that Continent
   Hadn’t been given a name.
   They ran thirty degrees,
   From Torres Straits to the Leeuwin
   (Look at the Atlas, please),
   And they ran back as they came.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   S’posing you could trot
   From Adelaide to the Pacific,
   For an afternoon’s run
   Half what these gentlemen did
   You would feel rather hot,
   But your legs would develop terrific—
   Yes, my importunate son,
   You’d be a Marvellous Kid!</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
