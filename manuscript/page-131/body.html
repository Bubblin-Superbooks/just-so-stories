     And golden elf-locks fly above;
   Her eyes are bright as diamonds
     And bluer than the skies above.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   In mocassins and deer-skin cloak,
     Unfearing, free and fair she flits,
   And lights her little damp-wood smoke
     To show her Daddy where she flits.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   For farâ€”oh, very far behind,
     So far she cannot call to him,
   Comes Tegumai alone to find
     The daughter that was all to him.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
