     Because of the seas outside;
   When the ship goes <em>wop</em> (with a wiggle between)
   And the steward falls into the soup-tureen,
     And the trunks begin to slide;
   When Nursey lies on the floor in a heap,
   And Mummy tells you to let her sleep,
   And you aren’t waked or washed or dressed,
   Why, then you will know (if you haven’t guessed)
   You’re ‘Fifty North and Forty West!’</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
