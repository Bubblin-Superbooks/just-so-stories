<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">Friend was,
     And I am the Man in the Cave.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Pussy will play man-Friday till
     It’s time to wet her paw
   And make her walk on the window-sill
     (For the footprint Crusoe saw);
   Then she fluffles her tail and mews,
     And scratches and won’t attend.
   But Binkie will play whatever I choose,
     And he is my true First Friend.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Pussy will rub my knees with her head
     Pretending she loves me hard;
   But the very minute I go to my bed
     Pussy runs out in the yard,
   And there she stays till the morning-light;
     So I know it is only pretend;
   But Binkie, he snores at my feet all night,
     And he is my Firstest Friend!</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
