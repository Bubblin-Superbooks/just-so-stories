     (They taught me all I knew)
   Their names are What and Where and When
     And How and Why and Who.
   I send them over land and sea,
     I send them east and west;
   But after they have worked for me,
     I give them all a rest.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   I let them rest from nine till five.
     For I am busy then,
   As well as breakfast, lunch, and tea,
     For they are hungry men:
   But different folk have different views:
     I know a person small—
   She keeps ten million serving-men,
     Who get no rest at all!
   She sends ‘em abroad on her own affairs,
     From the second she opens her eyes—
