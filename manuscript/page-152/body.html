   Pass Pau Amma’s playground close,
   And his Pusat Tasek lies
   Near the track of most B.I.‘s.
   U.Y.K. and N.D.L.
   Know Pau Amma’s home as well
   As the fisher of the Sea knows
   ‘Bens,’ M.M.‘s, and Rubattinos.
   But (and this is rather queer)
   A.T.L.‘s can not come here;
   O. and O. and D.O.A.
   Must go round another way.
   Orient, Anchor, Bibby, Hall,
   Never go that way at all.
   U.C.S. would have a fit
   If it found itself on it.
   And if ‘Beavers’ took their cargoes
   To Penang instead of Lagos,
   Or a fat Shaw-Savill bore
   Passengers to Singapore,
   Or a White Star were to try a
   Little trip to Sourabaya,
   Or a B.S.A. went on
   Past Natal</blockquote></div> </div>
